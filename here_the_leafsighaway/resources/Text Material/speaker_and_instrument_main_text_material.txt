which swifting aways the lightmurmers mentioning? the faint acceleration, the train moving under - swinging through breezes while all along the misleading multiple choice questions implying that anything can be so simple, so left-and-right when left and right are just directions, ways of looking, ways of drawing the line - never ways of moving or distances or pinesap or trains moving under feet or screeching forks against ceramic plates or words and pictures playing laughinggames + across a page - never simpling, never condensing or closing ears or pushing lips - permeating! watercolors still wet spilling through the pagefibers, carving portraits in capillaries where everyone is laughing at some unspoken joke and everybody is looking at everything and asking how it could all be so beautiful, so littlelaughingly, so leafsighaway: here the waitingnomore, here the rocketship, + here the tunnelwind and harmless joke and everyone just trying their best without realizing what their best really is, seeing in every other eye some question, some joke - protection of those closest being confused with negative opinions and violence, losing sight of the usness in every eye. no us or them, only we. +

the pineleaves resting

breath holdingly - crystallized into sugar or salt or quartz, shattering and spilling quietly among the clockwatchings and initials carved into tree bark, surging forward with the melting ice collapsing along a riverbed, glaciers unstuck in simple shapes, bubbles of icefoam and arpeggios resisting melodies - clouds and mists in place of arches and squares; techniques falling to the side preceding faceblushes and some countless sorts of forgetting, steady strings interrupted by unexpected pauses, shapes preceeding in flux, forgetting original intentions and focusing only on the coming instant: which direction it'd be best to fall toward - surface tension drawing tiny droplets up a stalk of mistaken assumptions, dew collecting into globes on the body on an ant. + + + + + + + + + + +

water boiling away out of a kettle -
rice somehow escaping the air.
salt and paprika -

some leaves caught
in a song around a
table

pinecones again always lighter and more sticky than expected

rarely used fireplaces and windowsills
always having the most surprising stories

a crackling treebark sharing some joke with the pendulum
was it to the expense of the grandfather clock or history book?
too early, perhaps, to tell

how ever to let an idea go without
harming its dignity?

hand and pen guided by wind, gravity, electrical currents (by nothing)

at some point we forget to ask
when it is time to applaud and have dinner -
rather - getting up and leaving at our pleasure
or by simple necessity
