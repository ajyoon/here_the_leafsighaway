%which swifting aways the lightmurmers mentioning? the faint acceleration, the train moving under - swinging through breezes while all along the misleading multiple choice questions implying that anything can be so simple, so left-and-right when left and right are just directions, ways of looking, ways of drawing the line - never ways of moving or distances or pinesap or trains moving under feet or screeching forks against ceramic plates or words and pictures playing laughinggames across a page - never simpling, never condensing or closing ears or pushing lips - permeating! watercolors still wet spilling through the pagefibers, carving portraits in capillaries where everyone is laughing at some unspoken joke and everybody is looking at everything and asking how it could all be so beautiful, so littlelaughingly, so leafsighaway: here the waitingnomore, here the rocketship, here the tunnelwind and harmless joke and everyone just trying their best without realizing that their best really is just seeing in every other eye some question, some joke - protection of those closest being confused with negative opinions and violence, losing sight of the usness in every eye - no us or them, only we.
